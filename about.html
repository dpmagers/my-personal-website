        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Dan Magers, and I am a writer and software engineer (in training). I have a PhD in English from the University of Illinois at Chicago (received in 2021). I also have an MFA from The New School. I have a BA in English and Philosophy from Loyola University Chicago. I have worked for many years in book publishing, then several years college teaching. Now I am training to be a software engineering, which is consistent with my past work in that it is work solving problems using languages.</p>
        <p>I published a book of poems entitled <em>Partyknife.</em></p>
