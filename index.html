        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>My name is Dan Magers. This is my website. Right now it is pretty barren. I need to experiment more with html and css (and JavaScript) in developing this website. However, as a writer (I am a writer), I get overly concerned with content. My mind blanks in the face of design.</p>
        <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, which I read like people watch television.</p>
